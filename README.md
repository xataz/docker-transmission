## Description
What is [Transmission](http://www.transmissionbt.com/) ?

Open Source.  
Transmission is an open source, volunteer-based project. Unlike some BitTorrent clients, Transmission doesn't play games with its users to make money:

* Transmission doesn't bundle toolbars, pop-up ads, flash ads, twitter tools, or anything else.
* It doesn't hold some feaures back for a payware version.
* Its source code is available for anyone to review.
* We don't track our users, and our website and forums have no third-party ads or analytics. 

Easy.  
Transmission is designed for easy, powerful use. We've set the defaults to "Just Work" and it only takes a few clicks to configure advanced features like watch directories, bad peer blocklists, and the web interface. When Ubuntu chose Transmission as its default BitTorrent client, one of the most-cited reasons was its easy learning curve.
